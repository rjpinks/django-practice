					I was born and raised in northern Illinois. I grew up in a husk of a small town that, at one point, was a pretty nice place to be. Growing up, I really liked to go fishing, playing video games, riding bikes out on paths. One thing that had a huge impact on me was my uncle giving me an iMac G3. It was one of the blue-ish green ones. The screen lighting up unraveled a whole new world to me.

					I really loved school, but I didn't have any money after I graduated high school. Being from a small town, I was dying to move away, so I joined the Army. I was lucky enough to be stationed in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. After a little under four years in the infantry, I got out with the plan of becoming a history teacher. I graduated from the University of Illinois with a BA in History and a minor in French.

					I spent a year as an assistant teacher in Riberac, France to see if I enjoyed teaching. I did, but I decided that it wasn't the correct job path for me. I'd rather be the student than the teacher. Afterwards, I moved back to my small hometown. I worked for a year in a steel mill to save money. Then, I took a full stack bootcamp to learn to develop software and further delve into my interest in computers. Unfortunately, post-Covid lay offs slowed down my career progress. On the bright side, I did find a job implementing software in a hospital. In the meantime, I've been further enhancing my knowledge base by study data structures and algorithms, devops, linux, and object oriented programming.
