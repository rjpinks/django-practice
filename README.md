# TODO
	1) splash page
		- enter personal information
		- create navbar
		- create styling

	2) create seeds
		- don't be lazy just legit

	3) create blog landing page
		- this should have a list of topics
			- FILTER display a list of all of the topics
				- make sure to have an all option based on topics
			- SORT the results
			- make sure to use PAGINATION
				- ORDER LIMIT BY style is probably fine to use
